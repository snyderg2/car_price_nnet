The only damage was a scrape on the passenger door that we did not fix and a rear bumper that we did fix.  No damage on the other.   Mechanically excellent; everything works and has very cold AC.  New battery, brakes, rotors, and tires installed about a year ago.  Selling because daughter decided to upgrade post college.  No email scams.

I just purchased it 4 months ago, and I have had some things change in my life and need to unload it. There is NOTHING wrong with it and I actually do love the Jeep! It still carries the factory warranty that is transferrable to a new owner with the ability to purchase an extended warranty. It is a Gladiator with the Mojave package and it rides like it's on air.  The Fox Racing suspension was definitely worth the money and the drive train is strong. The only thing I have done to it have been the AUX switches which are Mopar and installed the Mopar tonneau cover on the back. I am selling it at what I believe is an extremely fair price.

It is in excellent condition inside and out and has a fantastic carfax with the same owner here in Alabama since 11k miles.  This Camry has only 143k miles on it and it has all the luxuries you need with all power, factory mats, both factory keys and remotes, cruise, a nice set of matching tires and so much more.  Plus it has just been serviced bumper to bumper and has a new cabin air filter, engine air filter, new valve cover gasket, new motor mount and a fresh tires rotation and balance.  Please do not hesitate to text or call me with any questions you may have.  My price is firm but fair and the good news is I have no doc fees or admin charges... just the 3.875% sales tax and the 18 dollar title fee.  I also have the title and carfax in hand.  Good luck on your search for a Camry... you may want to check this one out.",al,33.353975,-86.866536,2020-12-01T08:48:34-0600

This truck is in excellent condition, fully loaded with just under 81,000 miles and always garaged. The pictures I have attached were taken 10/03/2020. You must see this truck to really appreciate the like new condition. The exterior color is called Lava Metallic which contains three different Metallic colors and really pops out in the sun. The interior color is Lava red and black and has motorcycle-jacket-inspired seats, a unique gauge treatment, piano-black trim, soft plastic accents. Chrome flourishes are limited to the grill and power running-board edge. The wheels are 22"" with the Harley logo and Nitto Terra G2 tires. The Motor is a 5.4 liter V-8 with plenty of power attached to a 6-speed transmission. I added Husky floor liners in the front and back of the floor boards. There are no tears or rips in the interior and the carpet is like new. You will not find a truck in this condition with these low miles for under $30,000 so the price is firm. This truck was $55,000 in 2010. This is a serious truck for someone looking for a like new truck without the new truck price.
